The [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map) can now show you where certain teleports take you by jumping to the corresponding location when clicking on the icon in the world map

The [Idle Notifier plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Idle-Notifier) can now notify you after not moving your character for a configurable amount of time

The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) has been updated to work correctly for coordinate and Hot/Cold clues located in the city of Prifddinas

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) no longer shows the task infobox on login
- The [Chat Notifications plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Notifications) has had its highlighting of messages with color improved
- The [Chat Color plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Color) now recolors the colon after the username of private chat messages, and the friend login/logout notifications
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) now highlights shortcuts within the Kourend and Forthos dungeons
- The [XP Globes plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Globes) has received an option to configure the tooltip information

Enjoy!
